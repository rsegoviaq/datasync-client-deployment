- âœ… Budget < $50/month
- âœ… Non-critical workloads
- âœ… Simple use case
- âœ… Development/testing

### Migrate to Full Agent:
- âœ… Transfers > 500GB/month
- âœ… Budget allows $220/month
- âœ… Mission-critical workloads
- âœ… Complex requirements
- âœ… Production environment

### Hybrid Approach (Recommended):
- âœ… Start with simulator
- âœ… Monitor for 3-6 months
- âœ… Collect metrics
- âœ… Migrate when justified by data
- âœ… Keep simulator as backup during transition
