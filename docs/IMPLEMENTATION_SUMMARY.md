# AWS Additional Checksums Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented AWS S3's Additional Checksums feature for the DataSync simulator, replacing manual SHA256 checksums with AWS's native server-side verification. This major performance improvement leverages hardware-accelerated algorithms and single-pass HTTP trailer-based checksums.

## Implementation Date
2025-10-21

## Key Changes

### 1. Configuration Template Updates (`config/config-template.env`)

**Added:**
- `CHECKSUM_ALGORITHM` configuration with 6 options:
  - `CRC64NVME` - AWS default (Dec 2024), recommended for general use
  - `CRC32C` - Hardware accelerated (Intel SSE 4.2), 3+ GB/s throughput
  - `CRC32` - Standard CRC32, good performance
  - `SHA256` - Cryptographic hash for compliance (slower, ~240 MB/s)
  - `SHA1` - Legacy cryptographic hash (not recommended)
  - `NONE` - Disable AWS checksums, use legacy behavior

**Deprecated:**
- `VERIFY_AFTER_UPLOAD` - Marked as deprecated and NOT RECOMMENDED
- Downloads files from S3 for verification (slow and costly)
- Replaced by AWS Additional Checksums API verification

**Documentation:**
- Comprehensive comments explaining each algorithm
- Performance comparison for 100GB files
- Best practice recommendations

### 2. DataSync Simulator Script Updates (`scripts/datasync-simulator.sh`)

#### Header Documentation
- Added extensive documentation about AWS Additional Checksums feature
- Documented performance benefits and supported algorithms
- Explained server-side verification and HTTP trailers

#### New Functions

**`get_checksum_algorithm()`**
- Validates and normalizes checksum algorithm names
- Case-insensitive matching
- Defaults to CRC64NVME for unknown values
- Returns empty string for NONE (disables checksums)

**`verify_s3_checksums_aws()`**
- **MAJOR IMPROVEMENT**: Verifies checksums WITHOUT downloading files
- Uses `aws s3api head-object --checksum-mode ENABLED`
- Retrieves checksum values from S3 metadata
- Supports all 5 AWS checksum algorithms
- Fast, efficient, and cost-free verification
- Logs checksum values for audit trail

#### Renamed/Updated Functions

**`calculate_checksums_legacy()`** (formerly `calculate_checksums()`)
- Renamed to indicate legacy status
- Only used when `CHECKSUM_ALGORITHM=NONE`
- Kept for backward compatibility and compliance records

**`verify_s3_checksums_legacy()`** (formerly `verify_s3_checksums()`)
- Renamed to indicate legacy status
- Adds WARNING logs about download costs
- Only used when `VERIFY_AFTER_UPLOAD=true` (not recommended)

#### Enhanced Sync Command
- Dynamically builds AWS CLI command with `--checksum-algorithm` parameter
- Conditionally adds checksum support based on configuration
- Logs which algorithm is being used
- AWS S3 validates checksums automatically during upload

#### Error Handling
- Detects `BadDigest` errors from AWS checksum validation failures
- Indicates data corruption or calculation errors
- Proper error reporting and status codes

#### Enhanced Logging
- Shows AWS Additional Checksums configuration at startup
- Displays server-side verification status
- Logs checksum algorithm in use
- Performance benefit messaging
- Clear indication of AWS vs legacy verification

#### Metadata Tracking
- Updated `last-sync.json` to include:
  - `algorithm`: Which checksum algorithm was used
  - `aws_additional_checksums`: Boolean flag
  - `server_side_validation`: enabled/disabled status
- Maintains backward compatibility with existing metadata

## Performance Benefits

### Upload Performance
| Algorithm | 100GB File Time | Throughput |
|-----------|----------------|------------|
| CRC64NVME | ~30-60 seconds | 3+ GB/s |
| CRC32C    | ~30-60 seconds | 3+ GB/s (hardware accelerated) |
| CRC32     | ~60-90 seconds | 1-2 GB/s |
| SHA256    | ~7+ minutes    | ~240 MB/s |

### Verification Performance
**Old Method (VERIFY_AFTER_UPLOAD=true):**
- Downloads ALL files from S3
- Calculates checksums locally
- Cost: $0.09/GB data transfer + time
- 100GB = $9.00 + 10-15 minutes

**New Method (AWS Additional Checksums API):**
- NO downloads required
- Queries S3 metadata only
- Cost: $0.0004 per 1,000 requests
- 100GB (1000 files) = $0.0004 + seconds
- **99.996% cost reduction!**

## How It Works

### 1. Upload Phase
```bash
aws s3 sync SOURCE DEST \
  --checksum-algorithm CRC64NVME \
  --storage-class INTELLIGENT_TIERING
```

**What happens:**
1. AWS CLI reads file data
2. Calculates checksum incrementally during upload (single-pass)
3. Sends checksum as HTTP trailer after data transmission
4. S3 validates checksum server-side BEFORE storing
5. Returns `BadDigest` error if mismatch detected
6. Stores checksum as permanent object metadata

### 2. Verification Phase
```bash
aws s3api head-object \
  --bucket BUCKET \
  --key KEY \
  --checksum-mode ENABLED
```

**What happens:**
1. Queries S3 object metadata (no download)
2. Returns checksum value from object metadata
3. Script logs checksum for audit trail
4. Completes in milliseconds
5. Zero data transfer costs

## Migration Guide

### For New Deployments
1. Use default configuration (`CHECKSUM_ALGORITHM=CRC64NVME`)
2. Set `VERIFY_AFTER_UPLOAD=false` (default)
3. Enjoy fast, efficient checksums automatically

### For Existing Deployments

**Option 1: Recommended (Full Migration)**
```bash
# In config file
export CHECKSUM_ALGORITHM="CRC64NVME"
export VERIFY_AFTER_UPLOAD="false"
```
- New uploads use AWS Additional Checksums
- Old files won't have checksums (uploaded before feature)
- Verification will show warnings for old files

**Option 2: Gradual Migration**
```bash
# In config file
export CHECKSUM_ALGORITHM="CRC64NVME"
export VERIFY_AFTER_UPLOAD="true"  # Keep for old files
```
- New uploads use AWS Additional Checksums
- Old files verified with legacy method
- Can disable VERIFY_AFTER_UPLOAD once all files re-uploaded

**Option 3: Compliance/Legacy Mode**
```bash
# In config file
export CHECKSUM_ALGORITHM="SHA256"  # or "NONE"
export VERIFY_AFTER_UPLOAD="false"
```
- Use SHA256 if compliance requires cryptographic hash
- Use NONE to completely disable and use legacy behavior

## Testing Recommendations

### 1. Algorithm Testing
Test each algorithm to verify AWS CLI version support:
```bash
# Test CRC64NVME (newest)
export CHECKSUM_ALGORITHM="CRC64NVME"
./scripts/datasync-simulator.sh

# Test CRC32C (hardware accelerated)
export CHECKSUM_ALGORITHM="CRC32C"
./scripts/datasync-simulator.sh

# Test SHA256 (compliance)
export CHECKSUM_ALGORITHM="SHA256"
./scripts/datasync-simulator.sh
```

### 2. Verification Testing
```bash
# Upload test files
export CHECKSUM_ALGORITHM="CRC64NVME"
./scripts/datasync-simulator.sh

# Verify checksums (should be instant, no downloads)
# Check logs for "AWS checksum verification complete"
```

### 3. Error Testing
```bash
# Test BadDigest detection
# Corrupt a file during upload (simulate network issue)
# Script should detect BadDigest error and report
```

### 4. AWS CLI Version Check
```bash
# Ensure AWS CLI supports --checksum-algorithm
aws s3 sync help | grep -i checksum

# Expected: Should show --checksum-algorithm parameter
# If not found: Update AWS CLI to latest version
```

## Backward Compatibility

âœ… **Fully backward compatible:**
- `ENABLE_CHECKSUM_VERIFICATION` flag still works
- Setting `CHECKSUM_ALGORITHM=NONE` uses legacy behavior
- Legacy verification still available via `VERIFY_AFTER_UPLOAD=true`
- Existing configurations continue to work
- Metadata format extended but backward compatible

## Security Considerations

### Algorithm Selection by Use Case

**General Use (Recommended):**
- Algorithm: `CRC64NVME` or `CRC32C`
- Detects: Accidental corruption with high probability
- Cannot resist: Intentional tampering
- Use when: Speed matters, trust network infrastructure

**Compliance/Regulatory:**
- Algorithm: `SHA256`
- Detects: Accidental corruption AND intentional tampering
- Cryptographic: Cannot feasibly create collisions
- Use when: Financial, healthcare, government, audit requirements

**Defense in Depth:**
- Upload: Use `CRC64NVME` for speed
- Archive: Calculate `SHA256` separately for compliance
- Store both checksums in tracking database
- Provides both speed and security

## Cost Analysis

### Per 100GB Upload

**Old Method (Manual SHA256):**
- Pre-upload calculation: 7 minutes CPU time
- Upload: Standard S3 PUT costs
- Verification download: $9.00 + 10-15 minutes
- **Total verification cost: $9.00+**

**New Method (AWS Additional Checksums):**
- Upload with CRC64NVME: +30 seconds (negligible)
- S3 validates automatically: $0.00 (included)
- Verification API calls: $0.0004
- **Total verification cost: $0.0004**

**Savings: 99.996% reduction in verification costs**

### At Scale (1TB = 10 x 100GB files)

**Old Method:**
- Verification downloads: $90.00
- Time: 100-150 minutes

**New Method:**
- Verification API calls: $0.004
- Time: <1 minute

**Savings: $89.996 and 99%+ time reduction**

## Known Limitations

1. **AWS CLI Version Requirements:**
   - Requires AWS CLI with `--checksum-algorithm` support
   - Introduced in AWS CLI v2.x (check: `aws --version`)
   - Older versions will fail with "Unknown options" error

2. **Existing Objects:**
   - Files uploaded before implementing checksums won't have AWS checksums
   - Verification will show warnings for these files
   - Re-upload required to add checksums to existing files

3. **Algorithm Availability:**
   - CRC64NVME is newest (Dec 2024 default)
   - Some AWS CLI versions may not support it yet
   - Fall back to CRC32C if issues occur

4. **S3 Glacier:**
   - Checksums stored with objects in all storage classes
   - Glacier retrieval required before verification
   - Consider this for archived objects

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Unknown options: --checksum-algorithm"
**Solution:** Update AWS CLI to latest version
```bash
aws --version
pip install --upgrade awscli
```

### Issue: "No checksum found" warnings during verification
**Solution:** Files were uploaded before checksums enabled
- Re-upload files to add checksums
- Or ignore warnings for old files

### Issue: BadDigest errors during upload
**Solution:** Indicates actual data corruption
1. Check network connectivity
2. Verify source file integrity
3. Retry upload
4. If persistent, investigate source storage

### Issue: Slow uploads with SHA256
**Solution:** This is expected behavior
- SHA256 is CPU-intensive (~240 MB/s)
- Switch to CRC64NVME for better performance
- Use SHA256 only when required for compliance

## Future Enhancements

1. **Multipart Upload Support:**
   - Current implementation uses `aws s3 sync`
   - Could implement direct multipart API for >5GB files
   - Enable parallel part uploads with part-level checksums

2. **Checksum Reporting:**
   - Generate checksum reports for audit trail
   - Store checksums in database for long-term tracking
   - Integration with ASC-MHL for video production workflows

3. **Automated Re-upload:**
   - Detect files without checksums
   - Automatically re-upload with checksums enabled
   - Progress tracking for large-scale migration

4. **Performance Metrics:**
   - Track upload throughput by algorithm
   - Compare performance across different file sizes
   - Generate performance reports
